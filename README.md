# LeadManagerProject

Project that applies the basic of the django was an api and uses react with webpack and babel to act was a frontend of the system.
React app created without using create-react-app.

What I Learned with the project:

React:
Fragments: Component to return multiple elements. Lets group a list of children wihtou adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Alert and handle error messages. Doubt: Django returns automatic bad request messages based on the the models, for the api requests(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) but what if we want custom bad request messages(mainly for language differences).
